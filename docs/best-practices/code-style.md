The [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq-and-more) concept was created by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), and they regularly publish updates to [their own radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). It is an opinated guide from the company to the community about that technologies and techniques they have been working on.

The radar is an [open-source project](https://github.com/thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar) and DB1 will consolidate and share it's opinion through this project in 2023. Our technology radar can also serve as a reference and source of inspiration for other companies and teams.

The guide will provide us 4 categories:

- Techniques
- Tools
- Platforms
- Languages and Frameworks

Weâ€™ve released the first-draft of our technology radar and will update it on an ongoing basis.
