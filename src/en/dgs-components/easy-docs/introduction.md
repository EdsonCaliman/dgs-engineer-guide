# Easy Docs

## Introduction

Easy Docs is a tool designed to simplify the generation of PDF documents from React components. In many projects, the need to create PDF documents, such as reports or contracts, poses a considerable challenge. Easy Docs addresses this problem by allowing developers to create PDF documents directly from styled React components, eliminating the need for inline styling. Additionally, our solution is Docker-compatible, making integration into various development environments straightforward.

## Objective

The main objective of Easy Docs is to provide an efficient and straightforward way to convert React components into PDF documents. This is achieved through an endpoint that developers can use to send data to the defined template, thereby generating the desired document.

## How It Works

The process begins with the development of a specific React template for the PDF document. Within this template, you can incorporate and style components as needed, and define properties that will be filled with the provided data. After completing the template creation, simply send the data to the Easy Docs endpoint. The system will then process this data and return the ready-to-use PDF document.

To use Easy Docs, simply run the Docker container and access the endpoint with the required data for document generation. With this approach, Easy Docs stands out as a practical and versatile solution for creating PDF documents in any project.
