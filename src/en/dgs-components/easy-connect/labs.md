## Challenge to practice

We have created some challenges for you to practice and test the tool. You may need additional knowledge such as tokens, client IDs, client secrets, etc. Don't worry, there are many tutorials available on the internet to help you.

1. Create a flow that, upon receiving an event from a webhook, saves the data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2. Create a flow that, upon receiving a postal code (CEP) event via webhook, fetches the complete address from the ViaCep API and sends a message to Teams with the complete address.
