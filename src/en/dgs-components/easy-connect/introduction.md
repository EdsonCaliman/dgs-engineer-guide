# Easy Connect

## Introduction

Let's talk about integrations and Easy Connect.
<b>Easy Connect is an INTEGRATION ACCELERATOR</b> and not a component.

Easy Connect is how DB1 works with the <a href="https://n8n.io" target="_blank">N8N</a> tool to accelerate the development of integrations.

Here we will demonstrate how we can use this tool, and we will also cover:

- Best practices
- We have prepared an environment for you to get hands-on experience and learn how to use Easy Connect.
- Where to use Easy Connect
- Where to AVOID using Easy Connect

## Objective

n8n is a workflow automation and system integration platform designed to simplify the integration of different services without the need for complex coding.

Its main objective is to provide an efficient and accessible way for users to create automated workflows.

## How it works

Through a visual drag-and-drop interface, n8n allows even users without advanced technical skills to configure and manage automations. This intuitive interface makes it easy to create integrations between applications and services, allowing data to flow freely without manual intervention.

With lessons learned from previous projects, DB1 has created a set of best practices that can be used to accelerate the development of integrations.
We will explore this in more detail in the following topics.
