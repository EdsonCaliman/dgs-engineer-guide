A software metric is a measure of software characteristics that are quantifiable or countable. Software metrics are important for many reasons, including measuring software **performance, security, maintainability, quality**, etc...

DB1 is very **metrics oriented** in its business so the engineering team has created a **complete guide** to access, understand and apply engineering metrics on your project.

You can check the *engineering performance guide* [here](https://github.com/db1group/engineering-performance-guide).
